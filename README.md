Fitness Tracker Ideas

I'm thinking that the fitness tracker app should adopt the ideas of video games. But instead, of having a viritual aspect to the app, We have an app that gives points, achievements, and rewards to those who participate in the app. However,  I can't think of to prevent people from just abusing it. In either case, It would be based off user input. If someone worked out for 3 hours; two hours weight-lifting and one hour of cardio, they can input into the app saying that what they did exactly. This would generate into a score and the result would be added to the users total.

Another idea I had was having the user input there weight and their set goal of losing weight. Each day the user inputs their weight, and the app can generate a graph of their weight loss (or gain) during their use of the app! This graph feature can also be used to see ones progress or certain excercise or the duration of their workouts.

I'm not sure if we should include nutrition into this, but if we are, we can include for recipies to be added into the app. As I mention before we would have rewards for using the app. Perhaps gaining discounts on certain things or winning new recipies from extensive use of the app.
